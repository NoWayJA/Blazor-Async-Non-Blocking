This project shows the use of Async and Await in blazor

In one way your Async calls form a traffic jam and queue up behind each other
In the other example, all your Async calls happen in parallel (much faster)

Awaits when used badly are one of the biggest causes of slow code, this project aims to give you a simple example of Awaits working well and working badly.
